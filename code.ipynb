    "\n",
    "Factors:\n",
    "* Crime rate\n",
    "* Median Age at Death\n",
    "\n",
    "We use three datasets:\n",
    "* Police Incident Blotter \n",
    "* Total Population\n",
    "* Median Age at Death\n",
    "\n",
    "A neighborhood has a higher crime rate indicate the area is not safe enough. No one wants to live a place has a lot of crime happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "People who live in a neighborhood with has higher median death age indicate that the neighborhood might have a good environment, public facilities, and good medical service. Because everyone wants to live longer. "
